# early-stage-depression-screening-tool
This the screening tool was designed to analyse the user's text predict the user text whether its' depressive or not. This tool used the Natural Language Precessing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Also, this tool is only able to predict the Bahasa Melayu text. 

The NLP techniques are used to perform the text pre-processing techniques on the dataset before the ML model was train and on the user's text before the pre-defined model were predicting the user's text. Since, the text will be in Bahasa Melayu. The Malaya Toolkit was used in the application of NLP in this tool. Also, the keyword extractor techniques will also be used to extract the warning words or terms in user text.

For the ML, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) or specifically the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model was been used to predict the user input text. the Scikit-learn (sklearn) toolkit was used in the develepment of the depression's predictive model.

To run this tool:
  1. Install all require package.
  2. Import the MySQL database from the database backup file.
  3. run the GUIv2.py code.
